Yonatan Setbon's project for creating diagrams for lanyards (aka scoubidou).
It has two versions:

the first is a simple way to draw a basic mXn (to iXj) stitch with no color and shades.

The second one is much more complicated and I don't have it done yet, it is still working only 20-30% of the time (would be glad if someone can take a chance and simplefy the code, or write a better algorithm that can solve it 80+% of the time).

If you work with eclipse it is better to disable warnings, (there are tons and is better not to delete any of them).

Create on your C: drive a temp folder (C:\temp), all the pictures will be rendered there.

Appriciate your help,
Yonyon.
