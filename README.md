Yonatan Setbon's project for creating diagrams for lanyards (aka scoubidou).
It has two versions, the first is a simple way to draw a basic mXn (to iXj) stitch with no color and shades.
The second one is much more complicated and I don't have it done yet, it is still working only 20-30% of the time (would be glad if someone can take a chance and simplefy the code, or write a better algorithm that can solve it 80+% of the time).

If someone need a question email me at:
ysetbon@gmail.com. 

Appriciate they help,
Yonyon.
